Data of this kind have a significant value, since they represent the basis for any credit card fraud analysis from which companies can extract information.  Moreover, financial data are classified as sensitive data and are protected in European Union by GDPR. This implies that it is very difficult to find open source dataset available for reasearch. For this reason in this research it was decided to use a credit card transaction simulator, designed by ULB Machine Learning Group. It will allow for the creation of credit card transactions on  an arbitrary time length (expressed in days). \n","The dataset created from this simulator will be used for the first part of our analysis. In a later section an analysis on real - world data (over few transaction days) is showed.\n","<h2> Author comments: </h2>\n","The simulated datasets will highlight most of the issues that practitioners of fraud detection face using real-world data. In particular, they will include class imbalance (less than 1% of fraudulent transactions), a mix of numerical and categorical features (with categorical features involving a very large number of values), non-trivial relationships between features, and time-dependent fraud scenarios.\n","</ul>\n","\n","\n","<h2> Design choice: </h2>\n","Our focus will be on the most essential features of a transaction. In essence, a payment card transaction consists of any amount paid to a merchant by a customer at a certain time. The six main features that summarise a transaction therefore are:\n","\n","    The transaction ID: A unique identifier for the transaction\n","    The date and time: Date and time at which the transaction occurs\n","    The customer ID: The identifier for the customer. Each customer has a unique identifier\n","    The terminal ID: The identifier for the merchant (or more precisely the terminal). Each terminal has a unique identifier\n","    The transaction amount: The amount of the transaction.\n","    The fraud label: A binary variable, with the value $0$ for a legitimate transaction, or the value $1$ for a fraudulent transaction.\n","\n","These features will be referred to as TRANSACTION_ID, TX_DATETIME, CUSTOMER_ID, TERMINAL_ID, TX_AMOUNT, and TX_FRAUD"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"caVfyphDdC1I"},"source":["\n","\n","The simulation will consist of five main steps:\n","\n","1) Generation of customer profiles: Every customer is different in their spending habits. This will be simulated by defining some properties for each customer. The main properties will be their geographical location, their spending frequency, and their spending amounts. The customer properties will be represented as a table, referred to as the customer profile table.<br>\n","\n","2) Generation of terminal profiles: Terminal properties will simply consist of a geographical location. The terminal properties will be represented as a table, referred to as the terminal profile table. <br>\n","\n","3) Association of customer profiles to terminals: We will assume that customers only make transactions on terminals that are within a radius of $r$ of their geographical locations. This makes the simple assumption that a customer only makes transactions on terminals that are geographically close to their location. This step will consist of adding a feature 'list_terminals' to each customer profile, that contains the set of terminals that a customer can use. <br>\n","\n","4) Generation of transactions: The simulator will loop over the set of customer profiles, and generate transactions according to their properties (spending frequencies and amounts, and available terminals). This will result in a table of transactions.<br>\n","\n","5) Generation of fraud scenarios: This last step will label the transactions as legitimate or genuine. This will be done by following three different fraud scenarios.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ShD8jZW8YVSg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1627902299766,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":529,"user":{"displayName":"Leonardo Imperit","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjd8gEDXnJ4o68GzrNP1qlXy4pkI6vkor6vbmgNCg=s64","userId":"16512763753431445034"}}},"source":["# Necessary imports for this notebook\n","import os\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","import datetime\n","import time\n","\n","import random\n","\n","# For plotting\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","\n","sns.set_style('darkgrid', {'axes.facecolor': '0.9'})"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nHlFeYIjdvCb"},"source":["\n","## Customer profiles generation\n","\n","Each customer will be defined by the following properties:\n","\n","* `CUSTOMER_ID`: The customer unique ID\n","* (`x_customer_id`,`y_customer_id`): A pair of real coordinates (`x_customer_id`,`y_customer_id`) in a 100 * 100 grid, that defines the geographical location of the customer\n","* (`mean_amount`, `std_amount`):  The mean and standard deviation of the transaction amounts for the customer, assuming that the transaction amounts follow a normal distribution.

This scenario is not inspired by a real-world scenario. Rather, it will provide an obvious fraud pattern that should be detected by any baseline fraud detector. This will be useful to validate the implementation of a fraud detection technique.  \n","\n","* Scenario 2: Every day, a list of two terminals is drawn at random. All transactions on these terminals in the next 28 days will be marked as fraudulent. This scenario simulates a criminal use of a terminal, through phishing for example. Detecting this scenario will be possible by adding features that keep track of the number of fraudulent transactions on the terminal. Since the terminal is only compromised for 28 days, additional strategies that involve concept drift will need to be designed to efficiently deal with this scenario.     \n","\n","* Scenario 3: Every day, a list of 3 customers is drawn at random. In the next 14 days, 1/3 of their transactions have their amounts multiplied by 5 and marked as fraudulent. This scenario simulates a card-not-present fraud where the credentials of a customer have been leaked. The customer continues to make transactions, and transactions of higher values are made by the fraudster who tries to maximize their gains. Detecting this scenario will require adding features that keep track of the spending habits of the customer. As for scenario 2, since the card is only temporarily compromised, additional strategies that involve concept drift should also be designed.
