This has to be intended as  a preliminary section in which we don't deal with many of the problems of credit card fraud detection, as for example the imbalance classification. Moreover we don't perform any cross validation to find best hyperparameters. All this matters will be discussed in later sections\n","\n","The training of a prediction model consists in finding the mathematical relationship that exists between two sets of features, called *input* and *output* features. In a fraud detection context, the goal is to find a function that can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or genuine (the output feature), using features that characterize the transactions (the input features).\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QSs2Zq7hoNso"},"source":["Let's first add our previously created imports and

It takes into account the fact that investigators can only check a maximum of $k$ potentially fraudulent cards per day. It is computed by ranking, for every day in the test set, the most fraudulent transactions, and selecting the $k$ cards whose transactions have the highest fraud probabilities. The precision (proportion of actual frauded cards out of predicted frauded cards) is then computed for each day. The Card Precision top-$k$ is the average of these daily precisions. The number $k$ will be set to $100$ (that is, it is assumed that only 100 cards can be checked every day). \n","* The Average Precision is a proxy for the Card Precision top-$k$, that integrates precisions for all possible $k$ values. \n","* The AUC ROC is an alternative measure to the Average Precision, which gives more importance to scores obtained with higher $k$ values. It is less relevant in practice since the performances that matter most are those for low $k$ values. We however also report it since it is the most widely used performance metric for fraud detection in the literature. \n","\n","Note that all three metrics provide values in the interval $[0,1]$, and that higher values mean better performances. \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZhgoOmU7QB-j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1625673111428,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Leonardo Imperit","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjd8gEDXnJ4o68GzrNP1qlXy4pkI6vkor6vbmgNCg=s64","userId":"16512763753431445034"}},"outputId":"d7bf24f1-f3db-4fd8-add1-ff311e39cf7e"},"source":["model_and_predictions_dictionary"],"execution_count":77,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'classifier': DecisionTreeClassifier(ccp_alpha=0.0, class_weight=None, criterion='gini',\n","                        max_depth=2, max_features=None, max_leaf_nodes=None,\n","                        min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None,\n","                        min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2,\n","                        min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, presort='deprecated',\n","                        random_state=0, splitter='best'),\n"," 'prediction_execution_time': 0.024343013763427734,\n"," 'predictions_test': array([0.00347371, 0.00347371, 0.00347371, ..., 0.00347371, 0.00347371,\n","        0.00347371]),\n"," 'predictions_train': array([0.00347371, 0.00347371, 0.00347371, ..., 0.00347371, 0.00347371,\n","        0.00347371]),\n"," 'training_execution_time': 1.966989278793335}"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":77}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"6HAzBkEvhh0y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1625673111435,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Leonardo Imperit","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjd8gEDXnJ4o68GzrNP1qlXy4pkI6vkor6vbmgNCg=s64","userId":"16512763753431445034"}}},"source":["def card_precision_top_k_day(df_day,top_k):\n","    \n","    #

prediction models have learned useful fraud patterns from the training data. This can be seen from the AUC ROC on the test set, which is higher than 0.5 for all classifiers, and an average precision much higher than 0.007. \n","* The random forest and boosting models provide better performances (in terms of Average Precision) than logistic regression and decision trees. This is also widely reported in the fraud detection literature. \n","* The relative performances of the classifiers differ depending on which performance metrics is used. For example, a decision tree of depth 2 has a lower AUC ROC than a decision tree of unlimited depth, but a higher average precision. Understanding precisely what these performances mean is crucial, and will be addressed in the next chapter. \n","* The performance of some classifiers (Random Forest and Decision Tree with unlimited depth) is perfect on the training set (AUC ROC and Average Precision of 1), but lower on the test set. In fact, the decision tree with unlimited depth is actually the worst classifier on the test set in terms of Average Precision. This is an example of a phenomenon called *overfitting*, which should be avoided. Moreover, their link to the target use case should drive the choice of the right classifier for deployment. The meaning of each performance metric will be addressed in the next chapter.\n","* The execution times for training ensembles of models (Random forest and XGBoost) is significantly higher than decision trees and logistic regression.
